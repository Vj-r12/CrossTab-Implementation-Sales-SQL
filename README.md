# CrossTab-Implementation-Sales-SQL

Welcome to the "CrossTab-Implementation-Sales" project! This repository is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of how to implement cross-tab functionality for sales analysis. Cross-tabulation, also known as pivot tables, is a powerful technique that allows you to transform raw sales data into meaningful summaries.

In this project, we focus on leveraging the capabilities of PostgreSQL, a robust relational database management system, to perform cross-tab analysis specifically for sales data. By exploring code examples and step-by-step tutorials, you'll gain hands-on experience in effectively pivoting and analyzing sales data using cross-tabs.


Here is the question & ouptut: 

Q1. Create the cross tab to analyze the city performance of quantity sold in category.

Output:

![Quantity_output_crosstab](https://github.com/Vj-r12/CrossTab-Implementation-Sales-SQL/assets/123143472/39953640-a1f5-4455-92c2-8bc79e5e8190)

Q2. Create the cross tab to analyze the city amount of sales by category.

Output: 

![Amount_ouput__Crosstab](https://github.com/Vj-r12/CrossTab-Implementation-Sales-SQL/assets/123143472/2c010730-aa7b-4fea-ad74-5278d189f7f5)
